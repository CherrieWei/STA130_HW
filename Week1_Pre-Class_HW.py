#Observations are the individual units that are being measured in a dataset and each observation can correspond to a set of data.
#In terms of my dataset, each observation would refer to the data of each passenger aboard Titanic.
#Variables are the types of information or characteristics that are being collected for each observation.
#In this case, the variables of the dataset include PassengerID, Name, Sex, and Age.

# In[7]:


#When you call df.describe(), it provides summaries of statistics analysis for numeric columns only. If you have many columns, but some are non-numeric, they won't be included in this summary. To get a summary for categorical data, df.describe(include='all') need to be used, but the statistical summaries would be different from whatâ€™s given for numeric data.


# In[8]:


#With respect to the value it reports in the "count" column, the discrepancies occur because df.describe() only counts non-null values, while df.shape reflects the total dataset size regardless of missing values.


# In[ ]:


#Attributes are used to store information about an object or class. Methods are functions and they determine the actions that should be performed on the object or class.
