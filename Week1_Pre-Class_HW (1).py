#Observations are the individual units that are being measured in a dataset and each observation can correspond to a set of data.
#In terms of my dataset, each observation would refer to the data of each passenger aboard Titanic.
#Variables are the types of information or characteristics that are being collected for each observation.
#In this case, the variables of the dataset include PassengerID, Name, Sex, and Age.

#When you call df.describe(), it provides summaries of statistics analysis for numeric columns only. If you have many columns, but some are non-numeric, they won't be included in this summary. To get a summary for categorical data, df.describe(include='all') need to be used, but the statistical summaries would be different from whatâ€™s given for numeric data.


# In[8]:


#With respect to the value it reports in the "count" column, the discrepancies occur because df.describe() only counts non-null values, while df.shape reflects the total dataset size regardless of missing values.


# In[9]:


#Attributes are used to store information about an object or class. Methods are functions and they determine the actions that should be performed on the object or class.

#Summary of Interactions
#Dataset Dimensions:

#Question: How to find the number of rows and columns in the Titanic dataset.
#Response: Provided a Python script using pandas to load the dataset and print the number of rows and columns using df.shape.
#Definitions of Observations and Variables:

#Observations: Individual units of data; in the Titanic dataset, each observation corresponds to a single passenger.
#Variables: Attributes or features recorded for each observation; in the Titanic dataset, these include PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, etc.
#Summarizing Columns in the Dataset:

#Question: How to provide simple summaries of columns in a dataset.
#Response: Suggested using df.describe(include='all') for a summary of all columns, including categorical ones, and df.info() for basic DataFrame structure and types.
#Explaining Discrepancies Between Dataset Size and Summary Statistics:

#Issue: Discrepancies between dataset size reported by df.shape and counts in df.describe().
#Explanation: Discrepancies are often due to missing values. df.describe() shows non-null counts, so columns with missing data will have counts less than the total number of rows.
#Attributes vs. Methods:

#Definition of Attributes: Variables that hold data or state about an object or class, accessed without parentheses.
#Definition of Methods: Functions that define behaviors or actions for an object or class, called with parentheses.
